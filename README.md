# fwd21ux_design_examples

## Find websites that have good examples of designs by:

- good navigation that is simple, predictable, consistent
- breadcrumbs (where am I?)
- content breakdown (not too much information in one place)
- good language and language structure (not too long text, clear headings, easy to read, etc.)
- page structure (right content in the right place, follows a natural flow)
- predictability (page structure guides me in how to proceed)
- call to action (an invitation to, for example, start subscribing)
- form (clear structure with division of content and feedback on input)
- animation (to help the user and give feedback)
